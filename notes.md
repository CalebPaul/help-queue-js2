##Help Queue
For this project, re-create the Epicodus Help Queue. Remember there is both a user and teacher side to the application. Here are some user stories to get you started:

###User
 * As a user, I want to be able to log a new help ticket.
 * As a user, I want to be able to close my ticket.

###Teacher
 * As a teacher, I want to be able to see all of the help tickets for students who need assistance.
 * As a teacher, I want to see how long a pair has been waiting.

##Further Exploration
As a teacher, I want to see statistics for the day: How many tickets were added, average wait time.
